Perhaps managing our processes to reduce their carbon footprint would lead us to a metric for waste versus efficiency.  Using this launching point, we developed the following ideas.

We started with, what would a Green software team look like?

Then we discussed, how does software make the world greener?

One of the biggest conflicts between agile and the environment is the high standard that agile places on face to face communication.  This really hoses telecommuting.  Today there are serious reductions in productivity when pair programing over the Internet, versus being colocated at the same machine.  We discussed what breakthroughs would be necessary to make pair programing over the Internet (virtual pairing) work better.

Outside of this session, a list of characteristics between traditional development and agile was developed.  These characteristics are thought to be important distinctions related to how development in one discipline impacts the carbon footprint versus the other.

We signed our names for future contact.  Much grief was given to Lance for leaving his cell number, but the harassers didn't know how laissez-faire Lance monitors his email.
