<p id="title">Overview</p>

<p>Agile Open Northwest, an alliance of agile practitioners in the US Pacific 
Northwest region, presents Agile Open Northwest 2010.

<p>We invite you to our fourth annual Agile Open Northwest conference. 
Alternating each year between Portland and Seattle, AONW conferences bring 
together practicing members of the Northwest Agile communities to explore 
the latest developments in agile software development. We held our third 
annual event, <a href="../2009">Agile Open Northwest 2009</a> , in Portland 
and enjoyed another great success.

<p>Please join us this year as we host 125 experienced, collaborative, committed agile 
practitioners from the Northwest U.S. (and beyond) in tackling the 
issues around our recurring theme "Agile for Real."  

<p>Your commitment to arriving at the beginning and staying until the end both 
days will ensure we build on conversation after conversation as we engage 
important questions like:

<ul>
  <li>What is agile really? 
  <li>What are the most important practices in making agile really successful on my team? 
  <li>Who practices agile philosophies, methods, principles or practices in the Northwest, and what's the impact? 
  <li>What is the difference between Lean, Scrum, XP, and other agile approaches?
  <li>What new technical challenges face agile? 
  <li>What are the latest cutting edge developments in the agile world?
  <li>How does agile co-exist with project management, process control and other governance structures? 
  <li>How do we adapt agile practices to our organizations without diluting them? 
  <li>Can agile methods work in big, risky projects? How? 
  <li>When distributed teams use agile approaches, what changes? 
  <li>What does agile adoption look like in an organization? 
</ul>

<p>The Northwest has a wealth of practitioners with years of
real-world experience with agile methods and self-organizing
teams. Agile Open Northwest offers an opportunity to strengthen our
community of practice and co-create the future for agile development
in our region. Feel free to browse the list of currently
registered <a href="participants.php">participants</a>.

<p>Your hosts designed this event to allow practitioners like you to meet in 
self-organizing groups where we can share our latest ideas, challenges, hopes,
experiences and experiments. We follow an <a href="openspace.php">Open Space</a>
format to foster collaboration and allow the conference to take its direction 
from the participants themselves. This two-day conference contains over 60 small, 
intimate sessions bringing novices, journeymen, and experts together for 
face-to-face conversations exploring the most important topics in agile today.

<ul>
  <li><b>What:</b> An <a href="openspace.php">Open Space</a> event discussing agile practices and techniques.
  <li><b>Where:</b> <a href="location.php">Seattle Center</a>, in several of the Northwest Rooms.</li>
  <li><b>When:</b> February 9 and 10, 2010
  <li><b>Who:</b> Anyone with some degree of experience in agile methods. Registration limited to 125 people. 
  <li><b>Cost:</b> $125 for the two day event, including continental breakfast and box lunch each day.
</ul>

<p>A comment from a previous attendee:</p>
<p>"These two-day Agile Open Northwest conferences are an extremely good value. ..[Y]ou learn directly from practitioners in the agile community what works and what doesn't.
I attended the first two of these conferences, they were stunningly good... loads of practical, useful stuff and stimulating discussions."  -- Ian Savage, PNSQC Program Chair
