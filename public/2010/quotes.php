<p>"I was able to reconnect with the Agile / Local community in a way that gives
me so much positive energy!"

<p>"After I leave this conference, it feels like I'm starting a new life [with]
ideas that make me say 'Wow, that's something I never thought of or considered
but I'm excited to carry it with me.'"

<p>"[I liked] running out of business cards."

<p>"High point: rekindling excitement and inspiration."

<p>"Feels like a gathering of old friends"

<p>"These two-day Agile Open Northwest conferences are an extremely good value. 
...You learn directly from practitioners in the agile community what works and 
what doesn't. I attended the first two of these conferences, they were stunningly 
good... loads of practical, useful stuff and stimulating discussions."  -- Ian Savage, PNSQC Program Chair
