        <p id="title">About This Site</p>
        <p> This site is provided by Poole Consulting / NUnit Software. 
		Charlie Poole did the original development with graphics assistance
		provided by Josh Blank and Phil Brock. The current design is by 
		Emmanuel "JR" F. Reyes.

        <p> Our logo is adapted with permission from that of the 
		<a href="http://www.agileopen.net/">Agile Open</a> event held in 
		Belgium for a number of years.
		
        <p> The main site uses PHP, HTML and CSS. It's intentionally kept very 
		simple so that it can be maintained by volunteers using freely available 
		software.
