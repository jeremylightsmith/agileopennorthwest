        <p id="title">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Why did we add a  third day?</p>
        <p>Six previous two-day conferences were packed with sessions and filled to the limit. Your hosts felt that adding a third day would be a chance to broaden the community. It turns out that when you have *two* nights to sleep on something, the magic really begins to happen the third day...and so we expect new sessions to be added that morning that grow out of what happened the first two days. Past attendees can tell you that some of the most interesting discoveries happen during dinner, and now there are two opportunities for that. And lastly, we've found having an retrospective on the conference afterwards provides us with the best ideas for next year...and now you can join us in contributing to that learning. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Who can create an Open Space session?</p>
        <p>Anyone attending Agile Open Northwest may create a session. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">What topics are suitable for an Open Space session?</p>
        <p>Any topic related to our conference theme is appropriate. Sessions may be on technical or non-technical subjects, but should relate to working with agile methods in the real world. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Do I have to be an expert in the topic to host a session?</p>
        <p> No, session conveners only need to have the level of expertise needed to conduct the session. If you intend to teach other people about something, we hope you actually know something about it. But you may choose to conduct your session as a discussion among peers or even organize a session around a topic that you know little about but would like to understand better. Be sure to explain how you intend to conduct the session when you invite people to attend it. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Can I add a session after the Opening?</p>
        <p> Yes, just speak to one of the organizers. We will have announcements of new sessions and changes at the start of each day and during lunch. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Will there be a record of sessions?</p>
        <p> At the end of the conference, we'll publish an online record of what sessions were held, who participated and what happened in them. The level of detail of this summary is up to the participants, but we will make a wiki available at the conference so that you can record information while it is fresh. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Can we schedule sessions in the evening?</p>
        <p> We have optional night-owl sessions on the schedule on Wednesday and Thursday evening in rooms at the Ambridge Event Center. We must leave the facility by 10 p.m. Of course, later on you can schedule sessions in other places like coffeeshops, restaurants, bars... use your imagination. :-) We also have early bird sessions at 8:00 am on Wednesday and Thursday for those who prefer the bright light of morning.   </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Are meals provided?</p>
        <p> We'll have a continental breakfast and lunches each day, and dinner on Wednesday evening. For dinner on Thursday, there are a number of restaurants within easy walking distance. </p>

        <p id="subtitle">Are accomodations available?</p>
         <p> There are a number of hotels, in all price ranges nearby. At the time of this writing, we are working on a discount at a nearby hotel. Please see <a href="location.php">the location page</a> and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/aonw">announcements on Twitter</a>. </p>

        <p id="subtitle">What equipment is provided for the sessions?</p>
        <p> All the rooms will have flip chart easels with tablets and markers. </p>
        
        <p id="subtitle">Will we have internet access?</p>
        <p> Yes, wireless internet access will be available. </p>
