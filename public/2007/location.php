<h3>Conference Location</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mcmenamin.com/index.php?loc=57&category=Location%20Homepage">Kennedy School</a>
is an historic elementary school in the Northeast Portland neighborhood. It has
been renovated by McMenamins and provides an ideal environment for our
conference.

<p>We will be making use of the former gymnasium for our opening session and 
using several of the renovated classrooms for our activities. In addition,
the facility features a restaurant and several bars for impromptu gatherings.
Wireless internet is available throughout the building.

<p>There are 35 guestrooms, 20 of which have been reserved for our attendees
from out of town. Contact the facility directly to make your room reservation.
