------------------------

PDF - Personal Delay and Fatigue - 20% of time allowed in schedule to cover
Include this information in estimating time and resources

How do you value slack?
* Down payment against technical debt
* Additional features and products you wouldn't otherwise see (eg. google news)
* Non linear advances 

How much slack can you afford? - 20% - 50% ???
What is the payback for slack? (Domain dependent?)

Can there be too much slack?
* risk increases with increasing slack
* increase slack time => decrease in efficiency (possibly addressable by adding some structure or constraint to the research/slack)

Goals of slack:
* Big ideas!
* incremental improvement
* insurance against risk -> don't run at full capacity to allow absorbtion of bumps
* overrun resulting from tight estimates can be buffered

$64,000,000 question:
* What is the minimum slack required to maximize net product (leveraging both linear and nonlinear advances)

How do you structure slack/creativity?

How do you make slack work have personal value? i.e. the same sense of accomplishment you get from regular story work

Should we rename it to remove negative connotations?

Plan for the unplanned by building in slack.  Its gambling, but entrepeneurs do that.
