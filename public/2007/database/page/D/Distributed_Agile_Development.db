Discussion of the various issues that effect teams doing distributed Agile development, and how they are managing them.

Three primary flavors of distribution:

1. Remote Customers (in different location than development team)

2. Distributed Dev Teams (more than one dev team, each in different location)

3. Dispersed Whole Team (everyone is in a different location)


Remote customers (approaches)

Group discussed that personal connections up front are very important to success.

Tools like instant messaging, teleconferences, etc. work well to supplement.

Demos can be done with shared desktop tools (GoToMeeting, etc.)

Important for trust that everyone uses the SAME communication method (e.g. don't have 10 people together and 2 on conf. call)

 

Distributed dev teams

- Travel frequently to establish real relationships between teams

- Have at least one person from each team spend time with the other team at all times

- Teams should not be "resources", but should own entire products or project areas

- Virtual pair programming (VNC, Skype) can help bridge distance

- Cross-pollinate existing teams, or Blow up the teams

- Use team-building exercises to promote unity

- Tracking tools, blogs, wikis are helpful (e.g. TRAC, ScrumWorks, ExtremePlanner)



Dispersed Whole Team

- Time zone issues can be stressful

- Scheduled meetings are necessary to deal with different time zones

In general, when specific agile practices are not feasible, go back to Agile principles, measure and adapt to make the situation work.  Examples: documentation, pairing, etc.
