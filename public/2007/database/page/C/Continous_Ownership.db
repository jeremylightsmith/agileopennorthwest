The group brainstormed possibilities for different ownership models:

   * expectation that this is for "mature agile" teams
   * owners within teams continously
   * all team members sharing ownership
   * features/stories morphing based on team consensus
   * ui designers going from detailed implementation to move freedom in design
   * agile encourages/forces feature vs requirement vs detailed spec

Communication between "owners" and "developers"

   * you want developers who won't implement things that aren't right.
   * being developers who get the "right code right" means values is higher.
   * developers don't want backlog with fixed, detailed, requirements - rather features that they can figure out how to implement.
   * maybe product owner (PO) continously available to team is answer?
   * perceived split between the authority (PO) vs. the responsiblity (the team)
   * PO is either a pig or chicken ...  do they contribute work or not.
   * Fixed iteration goals forces PO to commit to goals, insulates developers from responsibility for bad business ideas.

Quality improved by PO w/ tech and business skills.
People with [technical + business] are ideal, but hard to find.

Overlaying dimension of business vs technical is:
   * Skills vs Personality
   * Domain Knowledge vs Process Knowledge

--

Multiple interests are represented in ownership (PO + Dev + tester + UI + depolyment + sales & mkt + training /doc )

In a team you want:  UNITY, not uniformity

Idealy, ownership happens ALL AT ONCE.  Just as we now want tester involvement from the start, the more ownership interests the can be represented continously through team collaboration, them better.

--

brainstorming idea for possible new ownership model:

team pulls stories from backlog in the order the team deems fit to reach larger goal (priority resides in team).

--

PO needs to act as part of team to form larger team

Favor concensus, but PO must ultimately decide (single wringable neck?).

--

Group discussed ownership and overhead in large scrum projects (scrum of scrums in multiple layers)
PO fuzziness, must converse to resolve.

--

What do we want ownership of?


   * Ownership of those things we control or affect

   * Ownership of those things for which we have the skills and compotence.

Yet, the edge of these things are what is most exciting.  
The boundaries of our control and skills brings the greatest interest

--

Ownership Orphans - unclaimed ownership.

PO's lack of bandwidth to be the PO can be limit.

Personal relationship with PO may elicit ownership when combined with:
   ASKING for them to own it
