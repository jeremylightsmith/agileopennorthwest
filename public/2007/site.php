<h3>About This Site</h3>

<p>This site was created by Charlie Poole and is hosted by Poole Consulting.
Graphics assistance was provided by Josh Blank and Phil Brock.

<p>Our logo is adapted with permission from that of the
<a href="http://www.agileopen.net">Agile Open</a> event held in Belgium
for the past two years.

<p>The main site uses PHP, HTML and CSS. It's intentionally kept very simple.

<p>The Wiki is a slightly modified copy of UseMod. Most of the changes in
appearance were handled by CSS but a few of them required modifying the
Perl script that generates HTML elements.

<p>Our registration uses sporg.com.
