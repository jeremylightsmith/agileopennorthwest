    <p class="title">Conference Location</p>
		
    <p>Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, 
		<a href="http://www.seattlecenter.com/">Seattle Center</a> calls itself 
		"the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, 
		including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, 
		the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. 
		It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown 
		Seattle.</p>
        
    <p>This year we'll be in the 
      <a href="http://seattlecenter.com/locations/detail.aspx?id=27">Seattle Center Exhibition Hall</a>, located at 299 Mercer Street and directly across from the convenient Seattle Center parking facility. There are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings, including a McMenamin's pub for you Oregonians. For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.</p>

<p class="title">Hotel Information</p>

 	<p>For out-of-towners, we have made arrangements with the following hotels in near the center 
           for a special rate. 

<blockquote>
<h3>Pensione Nichols<br/></h3>
1923 1st Ave<br/>
E-Mail: <a href="mailto:info@pensionenichols.com">info@pensionenichols.com</a><br/>
<a href="http://pensionenichols.com/">http://pensionenichols.com/</a>
Phone:  206-441-7125<br/>
<p>Put “AGILE” in the notes when you register online or tell them you are registering for the agile conference if you reserve by phone.
<p>Our conference rate is $80 per night; parking is $14 per 24 hours.
<p>This is a small bed and breakfast hotel, but for this rate they are not serving breakfast.  We are providing breakfast at the conference.
<p>Notes on Pensione Nichols:  This B&amp;B hotel has a large, glorious English country shabby chic common room on the third floor with a glorious view of the sound where you can take your bottle of wine and talk all night.  The hotel backed up against the Public Market.  We negotiated a no-breakfast rate since we are providing breakfast at the conference, and the hotel doesn't start serving until 8a. Be prepared for a couple of long flights of stairs and no elevators, but the location and the view are worth it. The hotel is nine blocks from the Seattle Center and three blocks from the monorail.
