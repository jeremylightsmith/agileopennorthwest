    <p class="title">About This Site</p>

    <p>The current design is by Emmanuel "JR" F. Reyes, based on the original
    design by Charlie Poole. Additonal graphics assistance was provided by 
    Josh Blank, Phil Brock and Kirsten Comandich.
    
    <p>Our logo is adapted with permission from that of the 
    <a href="http://www.agileopen.net/">Agile Open</a> event held in 
     Europe for a number of years.
    
    <p>The main site uses PHP, HTML and CSS. It's intentionally kept very 
    simple so that it can be maintained by volunteers using freely available 
    software.
       
    <p>This site is currently maintained by Jeremy Lightsmith.</p>
