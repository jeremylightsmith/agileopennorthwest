<h3>Co-evolution Picnic - Wednesday, 7:00pm</h3>

<p>The agile revolution has been enabled by tools. Methodologists will grant this 
while they distance themselves from any particular toolset. Likewise toolsmiths 
are reticent to align too closely with agile methodology for fear of dividing 
their market too. This failure to embrace the obvious has slowed the growth of 
both fields.</p>

<p>Join us for an evening of suspended realities where we collectively imagine 
the tools and methods of our dreams. Ward Cunningham of the Eclipse Foundation 
will launch this progressive conversation using the participatory panel format 
called a Goldfish Bowl. This capstone event complements the distributed open 
space format while still engaging all attendees in a forward looking cooperation.</p>

<p>Biology calls the advance of intertwined species "co-evolution." We've chosen 
to call this event the "Co-evolution Picnic" because we're imagining for an 
evening that this evolution will be easy. Keeping with the picnic theme, there 
will be food.</p>

<p>In keeping with the theme, this event is co-hosted by Agile Open Northwest 
and the <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse Foundation</a>.</p>
