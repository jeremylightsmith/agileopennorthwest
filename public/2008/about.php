        <p> This site is hosted by Charlie Poole, who did the original development. Graphics assistance was provided by Josh Blank and Phil Brock. The 2008 re-design is by Emmanuel "JR" F. Reyes.</p>
        <p> Our logo is adapted with permission from that of the <a href="http://www.agileopen.net/">Agile Open</a> event held in Belgium for the past two years.</p>
        <p> The main site uses PHP, HTML and CSS. It's intentionally kept very simple.</p>
        <p> Our registration uses <a href="http://www.sporg.com/">sporg.com</a>. </p>
