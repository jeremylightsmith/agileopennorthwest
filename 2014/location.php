    <p class="title">Conference Location</p>
		
    <p>Created for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, 
		<a href="http://www.seattlecenter.com/">Seattle Center</a> calls itself 
		"the nation's best gathering place." It certainly has a lot to offer, 
		including cultural venues, sports arenas, entertainment options, 
		the Science Center, and a Food Court, in addition to beautiful grounds. 
		It is easily accessible by car, bus or riding the monorail from downtown 
		Seattle.</p>
        
		<p>We will be making use of several of the 
    <a href="http://seattlecenter.com/locations/detail.aspx?id=55">Fisher Pavilion</a>, 
		nestled between the International Fountain + the Armory (more or less in the middle of the center). 
		In addition, there are numerous spots nearby for impromptu gatherings. 
		For your dinner choices, a number of restaurants are within walking distance.</p>
 
 	<p>For out-of-towners, we have made arrangements with the following hotels in near the center 
           for a special rate.
