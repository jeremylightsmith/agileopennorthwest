<p class="title">Registration</p>

<p>Registration is limited to <strong><?php echo $event_limit; ?> participants</strong>. We sold out our first batch of 125 registrations in under 18 hours, so we've moved to a larger venue and added 50 more spots. We suspect these won't last long either, so <strong>register right away</strong>!</p>

<!-- <p>Registration is limited to <strong><?php echo $event_limit; ?> participants</strong>, so <strong>register early!</strong> Last year all available spots were sold in a few days.</p> -->

<p>Registration cost is <?php echo $event_cost; ?> and includes <?php echo $whats_included ?>.</p>

<p>A refund of your registration fee less a $50 cancellation fee will be provided for cancellation requests received before January 22, 2014. No refunds will be made after that date. If you are unable to attend, you may substitute someone else in your place.</p>

<p>The <strong>Register Now!</strong> button takes you to our registration service.</p>

<p>We use registration information to send you conference notice emails. Remember 
your user email and password in case you want to change your registration 
information or transfer your registration to someone else.</p>
