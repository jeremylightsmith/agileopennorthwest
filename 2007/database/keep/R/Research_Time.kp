We analyzed the problem of finding time for research on an agile team. Every participant was part of a group that does research, but how they went about it differed:
* be part of a dedicated research team for the company
* pad the starts of sprints with several days of research time relevant to the problems to be attempted in the sprint
* do small, costed research spikes (often to allow costing of a larger feature)
* do research outside of work
* "just do it" at work, since it's the right thing to do

How to "sell" research time to stakeholders was discussed:
* trading off production vs production capability 
* lost opportunity cost
* lack of research can be considered technical debt
* if you truly *believe* in it, they should trust you
* smaller items and one-offs will be easier to get approval for
* tricky since there are unknown endpoints
* value is hard to quantify (thus hard to trade off against stories/bugs/etc)
* it's a lottery ticket - you've got to play to win!

Other points: 
* not everyone is a researcher/likes to research
* self-initiated usually works better than mandated
* it usually goes best solo (not paired), in a divide-and-conquer approach with frequent check-ins between different team members
* you need a conducive work environment, not too noisy/chaotic
* info can be disseminated via pair-swapping or brownbags, which can be seen as lobbying efforts for new technology or techniques
* Slack by Tom Demarco was recommended http://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698
* you can hire new people to gain new expertise 
* cross-trained people (via pairing) are never quite at the same level as an expert developed through specialization
