<b>NUnitAsp</b>

Technology: Microsoft ASP.NET Web Applications

Method: Simulate client calls through HTTP to ASP.NET application. Client parses responses and validates the results. Tests primarily driven through NUnit.

Pros
* Mirrors ASP.NET control API with testers for each control type
* Drives tests through ASP.NET eventing model
* Helps developers write GUI's test first.

Cons
* Mocking business or data layers difficult
* Slow, since http request/response and HTML parsing involved
* Client browser is not a real browser (no JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
* Doesn't help with AJAX testing 

<b>Selenium</b>

Technology: Generic web applications

Method: Drives browser via JavaScript

Pros
* Tests can be written in many languages and are translated into a common language for execution
* Drives real browsers and is JavaScript aware.
* Has community momentum behind it currently

Cons
* IE challenged
* AJAX issues
* Security issues
