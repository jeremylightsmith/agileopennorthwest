'''Notes from Tuesday Session'''

(Thanks to Jennitta Andrea for lending me her notes, which I have reworded in places.  Please feel free to add your own comments about the session! --Dale)

Page 3.  Sam introduces himself.  He is somebody.  He has status.

Pages 4-5.  Sam is going somewhere.  He is being noticed... by the other guy who yas no name.  Let's call him Wilbur.  (Dale says:  Your relationship enters the room before you do, and influences everything that happens.)

Pages 6-7.  Sam rides through again, this time with a bigger sign.  More noticeable.  "I am important."

Pages 8-9.  Wilbur "resists" by saying, "I do not like that Sam-I-Am."  The "resistance" is from the relationship.  We don't know their relationship, the history behind Wilbur's reaction.

Pages 10-11.  Sam's sales pitch.  Pushy.  Sam is far away, and has not established a relationship.

Pages 12-13.  Wilbur refuses firmly, verbally and non-verbally.  Wants to retain control (which may say something about the relationship).

Pages 14-15.  Sam adjusts his sales pitch.  "Here or there?"  He focuses not on the eggs and ham (his product) but on the environment.

Pages 16-17.  Wilbur walks away and says (non-verbally) "You're not listening.  I'm outta here."  

Pages 18-19.  In a house?  With a mouse?  Sam offers incentives, sweeteners... bribery?

Pages 20-21.  Wilbur again refuses, more vigorously.  He was walked so far away that Sam is not in the picture.  "I would not like them anywhere" says that Wilbur's objection is not about where he eats the green eggs and ham.

Pages 22-23.  Sam persists, sending the message "you can't get away so easily.  This change is not going away."

Pages 24-25.  Wilbur walks over obstacles to get away.  "You can't make me."

Pages 26-27.  Sam changes his wording to something more like a demand:  "Eat them."  No longer a request.  Sam is the boss.

Pages 28-29.  Sam seems to be saying, "Trust me.  I know better than you."  He has a one-size-fits-all solution.

Pages 30-31.  Sam looks Wilbur in the eye.

Pages 32-33.  Sam is getting reckless, hurtling everyone up a tree an through the air in a car.  Wilbur may be the only sane one.  Lots of people put at risk.  Why is Sam so insistent?  He has some followers.  Why does he need Wilbur so much?  What is Sam's motivation?

Pages 34-35.  Sam and Wilbur seem to have tunnel vision, focusing only on each other and their disagreement.  (Dale says:  What's at stake for you in the changes you are promoting?  Is your identity at stake?  What makes this change so important to you?)

Pages 36-37.  "In the dark."  The eggs and ham aren't green in the dark.  Nobody can see Wilbur, so maybe this is a safe place to try a new food.  (Dale says:  Are you keeping people in the dark about some important part of the change, or about your real intentions?)

Pages 38-39.  Wilbur now calls him Sam instead of the full Sam-I-Am.

Pages 40-41.  So far Wilbur has said no 61 times.  Sam seems not to have heard.

Pages 42-43.  The goat is the same color as Wilbur.  It's as if Sam is saying, "The goat is just like you, and he's willing to try."  

Pages 44-45.  Sam is still offering to change the environment.  As a change agent, Sam seems to be a one trick pony.

Pages 46-47.  Everything is literally up in the air.  Chaos all around.  Before, Wilbur was only saying no.  Now he's saying, "No.  And furthermore, go away!"

Pages 48-49.  This has become a contest of wills.  The project around them is basically sunk (because of Sam's persistence/obsession).

Pages 50-51.  Back to the two of them.  Everyone else is offscreen.

Pages 52-53.  Finally, Sam acknowledges what Wilbur has said.  Now instead of "eat them," he said, "try them."  Acknowledges that Wilbur may ''not'' like them.  "Try them" requires less commitment, involves less risk.  "Try them" says that you don't have to eat the whole thing, but how about just a little taste to see what they're like?  Analogies:  Pilot project.  Practice on something less risky.

Pages 53-54.  Wilbur agrees if Sam will "let me be."  (Dale says:  Sam's sales tactic is to annoy his customer so thoroughly that the customer will do whatever Sam wants if only Sam will go away.)

Pages 55-56.  Wilbur likes the green eggs and ham.  He just needed to try them.

Pages 57-58.  Wilbur gets lots of support from the crowd.

Pages 61-62.  "Thank you, thank you, Sam-I-Am."  (Dale says:  This is the Sam-I-Am fantasy.  If people make this change they will love me.  How much is your identity bound up in needing others to change?)

Inside back cover:  Sam happy, proud, and ready for the next customers.  He's thinking:
::Am I a great change agent?  Yes I am.
::Maybe one day ''I'll'' try green eggs and ham.
