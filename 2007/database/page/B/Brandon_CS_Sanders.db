I'm a collaboration enthusiast!  Also an agile neophyte lurker from WardsWiki (PortlandPatternRepository, c2.com).  I find myself in the position where I get to create an agile development team at a wiki startup here in Portland http://www.AboutUs.org and so I'm stoked about tapping the wisdom of this gang.

Also ... http://RecentChangesCamp.org is happening here in Portland this weekend and it is going to be sweet!  Imagine what agile folks do as a hobby (you know ... changing the world type things) and roll it up with wiki goodness in an Open Space bun and you'll have an incoherent but somewhat accurate idea of what RecentChangesCamp is going to be.  Invite the folks you'd like to meet face to face and come on down for a good party that is getting better all the time :-)
