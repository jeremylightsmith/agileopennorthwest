* Usability, scalability could be substituted, perhaps (similar probs)
* Security constraints on agile team ti deal with audit
* bigger question is how to write secure code reliably
* work for engineers (& lawyers) to work out reasonable approaches to regulatory constraints & create meta-requirements outside stories/backlog items
* requirements traceability is an example of a security /business constraint that can be addressed with an engineering solution.
* Example given of agile project that continued to use "requirements tracking" by one person who linked stories to regulatory requirements (added specific requirements to each story item)
* to what extent should developers be security experts?
** maybe tech talks
** some participation in team
** security resources maybe too rare to participate fully in teams
* developers took over those testing role(s) that was improved by developers doing it
* What security role(s) could be improved by being taken over by developers?
** fuzz tests
** abstracting security requirements to meet multiple needs
** synthesizing contradictory requirements (security & function)
** methodology assistance in calling direct code with random (or not data) to see what's affected
** identify where file, net, other IO occures
** talk re/commercial products
* low-hangingin fruit
** unit tests to confirm code functionality (ie, if the story requires db connectivity, confirm only one case causes it)
** security intent intended in unit test
* Need for community co-ordination of agile security practices
