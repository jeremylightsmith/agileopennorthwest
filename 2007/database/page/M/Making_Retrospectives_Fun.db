Retrospectives can become dull if they are always the same. Following are notes on how to mix things up.

Vary the format:
* different timelines
* different activities
* choose a different goal (other than "improving the development process", which is the usual goal)

Gather data as a separate step from developing solutions. There are multiple activities possible in both these areas. Gathering data aslo helps to set a common framework.

Do we really want retrospectives "fun"? Well, fun means different things to different people, but we do at least want people to want to come back to the next one!

Timelines can look at project events, emotions and feelings, or other things during the period covered by the retrospective.

Try drawing pictures about experiences.

Sometimes writing instead of talking is good. Or, try writing down what "cannot" be discussed.

-----
'''Action Items are Critical'''

* Lack of progress in solving issues causes boredom. Make sure action items with owners result from standups.
* How about a "futurespective"? Use a timeline to specify the action items (with owners).
* Limit action items to one or two (maybe three).
* Prioritize action items.
* Make sure they are acheivable.
----
What about alternative goals for iteration retrospectives?

* An individual engineering practice (or several of them)
* Quality
* Relationship with other teams
* Team vote on a goal for an upcoming iteration.
* Suggestion box for goals or retrospective topics
----
'''Other thoughts'''

It's over when it's over - when the energy runs out.

Toys can help.

Shorter retrospectives often include team members only, those covering a longer period might have a wider participant pool.

For some groups beer (alcohol) can be fun, but it can cause problems too. Watch out!

Try changing the location - offsite (restaurant) or different place onsite. How about outdoors?

Retrospect on the retrospective. This can be brief.

Graph emotions on a timeline. Try color dots, stickers, band-aids, or other material aids.

"What was your energy level?" is a good euphemism for avoiding the "feelings" or "emotions" words, which are often intimidating for engineers (and others).

Draw a map of the "project world".

Knowing what works for your group helps in developing approaches and techniques.

Word associations - "this iteration was like..." (fill in the blank).

Playback theater - spontaneous performance - check it out on the web.

Interpretive dance? Ummm....

Deal with boomerang issues (those raised repeatedly in subsequent retros):
* make one a goal of the next retrospective
* get all players involved
* focus on why the issue keeps being raised but not resolved
* "How can we make it worse?" get the discussion flowing
* Spheres of control (influence) maps to see what change is possible
----
Other "topic" areas for the whiteboard:
* appreciations
* rumors
* team quotes
* funny moments
----
More ideas:

Take turns leading/facilitating.

Check out Norm Kerth's "Prime Directive" regarding safety.

Try a facilitator from another team.

Cross function retrospectives.
