'''Summary:'''
The topic of this open space was how to encourage bravery.  We discussed behaviors that encouraged (or suppressed) bravery in ourselves, our peers, the people we managed, and occasionally in our managers.  It became clear that bravery and honesty were often related.  We also discussed situations in which bravery/honesty is not appropriate.  One of the themes which emerged was that public and private conversation were both needed, often in different ways.

'''Questions raised (some answered):'''
* What makes it hard?
* How do you encourage bravery in a blame culture?  Can you?
* When is encouraging bravery/honesty a bad (immoral or counterproductive) idea?
* How do you encourage the quiet people?
* How do you encourage the slower thinkers and slower speakers?
* How do you counteract a bravery-suppressor?  Can you?

'''References mentioned or suggested:'''
* The six thinking hats method.
* Virginia Satire (and crew)'s temperature reading.
* Kathleen D. Ryan (sp?)'s pair of books: ''Driving Fear out of the Workplace'' is for managers; ''The Courageous Messenger'' is for non-managers.
* ''Radical Honesty'' was described as interesting, useful, and difficult.

'''Most important quote:'''
"Be brave, take leadership, and then ''step back''."

'''Details:'''
* Have the willingness to allow things to go wrong.  Step back.  Don't take problems away from people.
* It's very hard to encourage bravery if the manager is against it (in the specific or the general).
* One of the ways to encourage bravery is to exhibit it and survive, but be careful to not make others rely on your bravery.
* Support others' bravery, especially if they're taking a stance that's not popular.  Be explicit as well as implicit about it.
* One way to help others say difficult things in tough circumstances is to have anonymous idea submissions that are then handled by the group.  The manager of the group should be careful to not react negatively, because people will be watching.
* Often managers have a choice between hearing bad news or good lies.  What they hear often depends on their past reactions.
* Thank people for bringing you bad news.
* One manager had bad news candybars to provide position associations.  People would ask for a candybar and then explain why they deserved it.
* If managers have negative reactions to unpleasant truths, it can be helpful for them to roleplay someone presenting an unpleasant truth to a manager, so they emotionally understand why negative reactions are daunting.
* Consultants are often in a safer space to say uncomfortable things, because it's not their career at risk.
* It helps if people see their managers (and especially people above their managers) as real people.
* People whose bonuses depend on things that aren't going to happen are reluctant to see that truth and will fight against it.
* Sometimes there are moral hazards: bonuses or other incentives are encouraging people to fight against their own success.
* Sometimes there are sufficient structural issues that bravery is a bad idea, but more often, that's a convenient excuse.
* It can be helpful to ask what the worst possible outcome is -- it's often not as bad as people fear.
* A person who is ready to leave is stronger.
* It's often easier to face being fired than being devalued and shoved into a dead-end job.  It saves face and it doesn't make you decide anything.
* Private support can be good for quieter people, either before or after the fact.
* Small groups can be good to draw people out.
* Brainwriting can be a useful replacement for brainstorming if the fast-speaking people are drowning out the slower ones: everyone writes down ideas and then each person gives one.
* It can be helpful to mentally count to 10 before closing a meeting, so you don't prevent someone from saying something.
* Ending a meeting with "What does everyone know, but no one's been willing to tell me?" can be helpful, but annoys people.  Much of the benefit from it comes outside of meetings: people know you want to hear things.
* Positive comments are good for building trust.  As more trust exists, it's safe to put more negative ones in.
* Be explicit about what you want.
* It can be helpful to start a meeting with people's feelings, even non-work-related ones.
* Accidental/incidental conversations are good.
* Toys or jigsaw puzzles are good for causing accidental conversations.  They're also good tools for uncomfortable conversations.  "They give the introverts something to start at so they don't have to look at each other"
* Smoke breaks, water breaks, and bathroom breaks provide good opportunities for accidental conversations.
* Usually people avoid bravery for fear of consequences.  Sometimes these consequences are real; sometimes imagined or inflated.  Those scenarios should be treated very differently.
* If someone is inflating bad consequences, it's good to be a sounding board and source of realism.
* If you're afraid of someone reacting badly, it can be good to just see what happens; allow them to be the bad guy if they're going to be, but don't make them into one.
* Take problems private when appropriate.
* It's harder to bring problems to a manager's attention if they're that manager's fault.
* Be aware of the social consequences of people's reactions.  Give them safe space to react badly.
* Messages often go over better with humor.  That requires trust.
* "We need to remember that we're all human."  Everyone has bad days.
* Pick the right battles.  Peers who see you start trivial battles will become disenheartened.
* Being blunt means that people know you'll say what you mean and mean what you say.
* It can be easier to get along with blunt people, because you needn't fear that they're hiding problems from you.
* If you criticize someone, it helps to be willing to work with them to solve it.
* Supporting the people who are being suppressed helps.  Even small amounts of private support help.
* If people aren't being heard or listened to, putting what they've said on the meeting's flipchart helps.
* Meetings are helped if the meeting-caller makes it clear that the Law of Two Feet applies here too.
* Only invite the proper people to a meeting -- others will more likely cause trouble than help.
* Outrageous rewards for being brave can be helpful.
* Public and private behavior must match (not in exact actions, but in tone and message).
* You need to be willing to make a fool out of yourself.
* Getting things started is important, and can allow other people to act.
* Be brave, take leadership, and then ''step back''.
