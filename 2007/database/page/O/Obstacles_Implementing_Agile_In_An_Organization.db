Topic : Obstacles implementing agile in an organization 

Host and Note-taker : Jens Østergaard

About 15 people showed up for the topic. Discussions were good and we quickly realized that this is a huge topic that we can not solve in a session last an hour and a half.

First half of the session went with attaedees sharing there experience while I wrote key words down on a flip-chart. After that we wrote all keywords on post-it and then grouped them. Three main areas came out of the clustering as listed below.

After that we had a vote on which of vthe main groups would be the biggest obstacle. From that we worked our way thru possible ways of atacking the problems. Then we finally tried to come up with an expression that would kind of summon the whole thing.


These are the 3 main areas, number of votes and which expressions belongs to which cluster


Team Issues (1 vote)
- Agile Islands
- Safety nets (attitude)
- Competing methologies
- Engineering vs art
- Trust issues
- Expectation of multitasking
- Wrong team
- Adopting pair programming
- Individual compensation
- Fear of loss

Misunderstanding Agile (4 votes)

- Acceptable level of failure
- Misunderstanding agile

Upper management / structural issues (7 votes)
- Priorities change daily
- Inability to estimate
- Scope creep
- Seating arrangement (& furniture)
- Regularatory requirements
- Team stability
- Contracting
- Perception that agile is open-ended
- Need for customer time
- Can't meet firm deadline
- False starts

After this we launched into ways of solving the obstacles, and particularly those with many votes. 

- Market agile (CEO magazines, agile alliance, etc)
- Better information
- Talk to upper management
- Blog


Comming up with something that would summon it up, we came up with "Promoting a solution to a specific problem". After a few discussions we decided to change that to
NETWORKING

Thanks all for participating - Jens

I attended this discussion and enjoyed it very much. I especially liked the self organising aspect (http://curious-attempt-bunny.blogspot.com/2007/01/im-already-fan-of-open-space.html).
