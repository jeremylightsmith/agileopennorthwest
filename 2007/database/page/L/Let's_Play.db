Justin introduced the topic by saying that his team makes a point of taking breaks to play during the workday, so he wanted to do the same in the conference.

Other participants mentioned that they don't tend to take breaks for play at work.

We played a few games together, all standing in a circle:

* '''Name a language,''' made up on the spot &mdash; Each person says the name of a programming language and then throws an orange to someone else who does the same, until we get stuck or bored.

* '''One-word story,''' a standard improv game &mdash; Each person says a single word of a story, going around the circle until the story feels complete. Ours involved, naturally, teams drinking beer.

* '''Werewolf,''' http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html &mdash; Players draw cards, becoming either villagers or werewolves. The players rebelled a bit, with some villagers refusing to participate in lynching (Esther insisted on finding a cure for werewolfism instead), and with one of the werewolves killing the other; the result was that the humans prevailed, despite the even number of players (eight).

We briefly debriefed each game by asking "How is this relevant to our work?" Justin likes one-word story as an analogue of test-driven development and pair programming, with each person adding a tiny bit to the story. Esther and others mentioned that Werewolf invokes issues of hidden agendas and trust on a team.
