 Why? What?
	Follow the sun
	Telecommuting with bad weather
	Non-programming projects that need coordination
	Mostly colocated, with a few outliers

Things that work?
	Skype, permanent condenser microphone, speakers
	Every few weeks spend a few times together (retrospectives, other syncing)
	IM/IM chat rooms
		signal vs. noise
	Skype + vnc, other screen sharing (Webex)
		VNC: Code TV
	Voice a problem if English is a problem. IRC can be easier

Tools for distributed management
	As close to dragging around cards
	homebrew
	ScrumWorks, RallyDev, XPlanner
	IBM Jazz - built into Eclipse? Task sharing, Integrated chat, it's own versioning system, etc
	Wikis
		Lots of problems. One guy likes it
			Data goes stale very easily
			Switch to Google Spreadsheet, other dedicated tools
	ScrumWorks
		Track history, log, user roles

	Most tools are too complicated
	Trac
		Simple, has wiki, tie to source control
		Tickets as features, sub-tickets as tasks
		States: To-do, in progress, done, accepted
			Others added deployed, rejected (story was rejected by client)
	
	Simultaneous movement
	Simultaneous edit
		Writely
		SubEthaEdit
		MS tool?

Problems would you like to solve w/tools
	Tracking informal communication
	Standup meetings that aren't lame
		Condenser mic made it much better
		But they are more likely (or not) to turn into status meetings
			Need more face time so people will feel free to keep others on track

Tool-resistant problems
	Shared culture
	Product owner is onsite with only part of the team
		Locals get undue share of praise in good times, burden in bad times

Tool failures
	Archived email threads (see informal communication)

Vs. Open Source
Distributed version control
	git, bzr, mercurial, svk
