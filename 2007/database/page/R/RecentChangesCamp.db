Format:  Open Space (same as this conference)

You are reading this Invitation because someone wants to see you at RecentChangesCamp 2007. RecentChangesCamp is an un-conference (Bar Camp), which is of, by, and for folks who want to "build communities worth having" both online and off. This especially includes the Open Technology/Open Culture movement.

We are coming together to make connections, write code, have fun, revise the Cybernetic Roadmap, do as much good work as each and every one of us can … and then go home more connected, more energized and more capable of building great communities and the tools they depend on. Bring your friends and join a good party that's growing even better!
