Currently, it is very hard for them to give estimates with any confidence because requirements:<br> <br>
1)  are constantly changing<br>
2)  have virtually no detail to them<br>
3)  are delivered to "whoever" from an executive level<br><br>

Additionally:<br>
1) the team is spread very thin<br>
2) the company is very schedule driven<br><br>

Some suggestions offered by the rest of the group:<br><br>
1) get someone on your team whose job it is to gather real requirements (like a BA)<br>
2) don't allow yourself to get pressured into giving estimates that imply more accuracy than you actually have (i.e. - don't commit to delivering on Feb. 15 if all you really know is that you will deliver some time in Feb - Mar)<br>
3) use Scrum to deliver usable, valued functionality each Sprint<br>
4) Identify a Product Owner who can act as a single point of contact for requirements (co-locating this person with the team was suggested if possible)
