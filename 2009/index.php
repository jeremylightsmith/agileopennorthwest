<p id="title">Overview</p>

<p>Agile Open Northwest, an alliance of agile practitioners in the US Pacific 
Northwest region, presents Agile Open Northwest 2009.

<p>We invite you to our third annual conference. Our first conference in Portland 
brought together members of the Northwest Agile communities. We held our second 
annual event, <a href="2008/index.php">Agile Open Northwest 2008</a>, last year 
in Seattle and enjoyed another great success. 

<p>Please join us this year as we host 100 experienced, collaborative, committed agile 
practitioners from the Northwest U.S. (and beyond) in tackling the 
issues around our theme "Agile for Real."  

<p>Your commitment to arriving at the beginning and staying until the end both 
days will ensure we build on conversation after conversation as we engage 
important questions like:

<ul>
  <li>What is agile really? 
  <li>What does agile development look like in the real world? 
  <li>Who practices agile philosophies, methods, principles or practices in the Northwest, and what's the impact?
  <li>What does agile or agility look like in organizations?
  <li>What new technical challenges face agile?
  <li>How does agile co-exist with project management, process control and other governance structures?
  <li>How do we adapt agile practices to our organizations without diluting them?
  <li>Can agile methods work in big, risky projects? How?
  <li>When distributed teams use agile approaches, what changes? 
  <li>When an organization chooses a transition to agile, what really changes? 
</ul>

<p>The Northwest has a wealth of practitioners with years of real-world 
experience with agile methods and self-organizing teams. Agile Open Northwest 
offers an opportunity to strengthen our community of practice and co-create 
the future for agile development in our region. Feel free to browse the list of currently registered <a href="participants.php">participants</a>.

<p>Your hosts designed this event to allow practitioners like you to meet in 
self-organizing groups where we can share our latest ideas, challenges, hopes,
experiences and experiments. We follow an <a href="openspace.php">Open Space</a>
format to foster collaboration and allow the conference to take its direction 
from the participants themselves.

<p>A comment from a previous attendee:</p>
<p>"These two-day Agile Open Northwest conferences are an extremely good value. ..[Y]ou learn directly from practitioners in the agile community what works and what doesn't.
I attended the first two of these conferences, they were stunningly good... loads of practical, useful stuff and stimulating discussions."  -- Ian Savage, PNSQC Program Chair
